# War-Card-Game
A digital version of the War card game created using Python, Pygame, and VS code.

The game was programmed using an object-oriented approach.

The game is played by clicking on the player deck (located at the bottom of the screen) to play a card.
The player plays against the computer, who automatically plays a card after the player.
